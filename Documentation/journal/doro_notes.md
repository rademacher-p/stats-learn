# 4.1.2
- [x] eq 4.1, eq 4.3: lose geometric?
  - A: Made a note. Which form IS used? Does it hurt?
- [ ] eq 4.6: divide by zero! **specify domain**
  - *Union of Xn*!?
  - Use PMF, finite subset of Ycal?

- [x] semicolon confusing? Use bold/case to distinguish?
  - A: Keeping as is, or switch to serial brackets? Bold/case common for linear algebra, but not for analysis - may be confusing.
- [ ] dirac vs kron, use diff. font!? partial delta?
- [ ] CDF?

# 4.2
- [ ] **divide by dirac zero**!?
- [ ] dirac amplitude **doesn't** necessarily tend to infinity, think sinc func?
- [ ] eq 4.12: CDF use to avoid div inf? *Difference of CDF values*?

- [ ] plot PDFS for sec 4.3

# 5
- [x] "severe drawbacks"
  - A: Changed
- [x] "cardinality reducing"
  - A: Changed.
- [x] contiguous vs continuous vs connected
  - A: Switched to "connected spaces"!
- [x] discretization vs quantization
  - A: Former is more common in ML terminology, code, etc.
- [x] use projection terms
  - A: Inappropriate, transform is non-linear?!
- [x] PDF tends in what sense?
  - A: Different types are for RV convergence, not function convergence?
