# 4.1.2
- eq 4.1, lose geometric?
- eq 4.3, lose geometric
- eq 4.6: divide by zero! **specify domain**
  - *Union of Xn*!?
  - Use PMF, finite subset of Ycal?

- semicolon confusing? Use bold/case to distinguish?
- dirac vs kron, use diff. font!? partial delta?
- CDF?

# 4.2
- **divide by dirac zero**!?
- dirac amplitude **doesn't** necessarily tend to infinity, think sinc func?
- eq 4.12: CDF use to avoid div inf? *Difference of CDF values*?

- plot PDFS for sec 4.3

# 5
- "severe drawbacks"
- *"cardinality reducing"*
- contiguous vs continuous vs connected
- discretization vs quantization
- use projection terms

- PDF tends in what sense?
