- [x] Describe sim example
  - *Use thesis eqs and figs!*
- [x] Predict stats fig placement?
  - After formulae for context? Or up front to illustrate example?
- [x] Move P_y_x equivalence earlier?
- [x] Check for missing citations
  - Multiple footnote cite error?
  - *OK with excluded ones*
- [x] Check for residual Drm

# Talking Points
- Bayes Optimal Regressor
  - Regressor inherits trends from posterior dist.
- Prediction Statistics
  - Use thesis p.81 exposition
- Optimal Localization
  - Trends with bias and model variance (OVERFITTING)
  - Optimal value independent of N
  - May not be able to use formula in practice, but next slide shows consistency
