- Use both discrete and continuous
  - for math impact and realism
- Bayesian and conditional risk results
  - for math impact
- Discuss bias/variance SE trade-off
  - nice plots, link to math
  - model estimation perspective, too?

# Primary objectives
- Non-trivial data support for discrete results
  - realism for reader
- Find a sensible application for "countable" continuous data support
  - Needed to make continuous Dirichlet viable
- Compare to classic algorithms (Normal regressor)
  - help reader relate
  - demonstrate Dirichlet consistency vs Normal loss


# Results log

### 1 - norm vs dir loss vs N
16 point grid
.5 + 0*x prior mean
x**4 true mean

### 2 - alpha_0 loss min
.5 + .2*x true mean
up to 100 a_0
