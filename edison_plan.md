### Schedule
- #### Spring 2020
  - Submit my drafted paper "Bayesian Learning for Regression using a Dirichlet Prior Probability Distribution" to the 2020 IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing
  - Perform research on Bayesian learning with low-dimensionality support prior distributions and apply to human recognition applications
    - Submit to the 2020 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (*time permitting*)
  - Expand conference submission on Bayesian Regression with my existing results and submit to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing or IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory (Topic: statistical estimation and inference)
- #### Fall 2020
  - Complete and submit paper on limited-support prior Bayesian learning to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing or IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
    - *Time-permitting. Second paper increases likelihood of completing journal requirement.*
  - Draft my Thesis using existing documentation and new research results
- #### Spring 2021
  - Present a ECE department seminar
  - Complete my Thesis
  - Pass the Final Examination
